## Project Title: DETECTION OF CHEST X-RAY ABNORMALITIES USING DICOM IMAGES
## Organization: Accure, Inc.

## Problem Description
Existing methods of interpreting chest X-ray images classify them into a list of findings. There is currently no specification of their locations on the image which sometimes leads to inexplicable results. A solution for localizing findings on chest X-ray images is needed for providing doctors with more meaningful diagnostic assistance.

## Implementation Platform: Python on GMU Hopper Cluster Platform

## Project Duration: August 2022 - December 2022
## Overview
The dataset for this study was created by the Vingroup Big Data Institute (VinBigData) and was acquired via the Kaggle website(https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/vinbigdata-chest-xray-abnormalities-detection/overview).There are 18,000 Postero-anterior (PA) view CXR scans with localization of important features and classification of prevalent thoracic illnesses make up the dataset. The goal is to train object detection computer vision model to detect common thoracic lung diseases and localize the findings.
