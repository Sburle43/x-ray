#Project Title
DETECTION OF CHEST X-RAY ABNORMALITIES USING DICOM IMAGES
Organization:
Accure, Inc.

Problem Description
Existing methods of interpreting chest X-ray images classify them into a list of findings. There is currently no specification of their locations on the image which sometimes leads to inexplicable results. A solution for localizing findings on chest X-ray images is needed for providing doctors with more meaningful diagnostic assistance.
Project Goals
Train object detection computer vision model to detect common thoracic lung diseases and localize the findings.
